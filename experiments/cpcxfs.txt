Use cpcxfs to make a disk image:

cpcxfs -nd myprog.dsk

this means create a new disk

cpcxfs myprog.dsk -p a.cpc myprog

this means to add a.cpc (but call it "myprog") to myprog.dsk

Both of these can be downloaded from www.cpctech.org.uk but you may need to build the executables of them.
