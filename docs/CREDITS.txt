CREDITS

I have been helped by people who are involved in the cross compilers Z88Dk, CC65, CMOC development, as well as other people from different 8 bit "scenes".

This is just a partial list.

Stefano Bodrato: lots of help on all Z80 targets including development on the Z88Dk to support my game.

Simon Jonassen: Help on getting a good routine for the keyboard input for all CoCo and Dragon models.

Christian Groessler: has helped me to improve the Makefile and fix an issue on the Atari 8-bit color version.
